I spent 1.5 hours working on something that should create a code to put here. People who decoded it would be instructed to message me something.

After 1.4 hours of debugging I found out that it didn't work because Javascript doesn't handle specific unicode characters consistently.

I think that experience summarizes me pretty well.
